# Implementation-of-Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
This code is implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given input value 'n'. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking as composite (i.e., not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2
